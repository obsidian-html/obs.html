# obs.html Obsidian plugin
This plugin aims to export the html that Obsidian generated in the view mode to a folder, currently the `obs.html/export` folder directly in the vault.

## Installation
Same as every other plugin, see Obsidian docs. 

Tl;dr:
- git clone this repo in `your/vault/.obsidian/plugins`
- enable community plugins in settings
- reload plugins
- enable this plugin

## Usage
Click the paper airplane icon in the icon bar, this will create folder `<your/vault>/obs.html/export` and then create an html file per markdown note in your vault.
